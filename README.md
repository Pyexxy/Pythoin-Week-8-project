# Pythoin-Week-8-project
COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

Description

This project tracks COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations for Kenya, USA, and India using data from Our World in Data. It cleans the data, analyzes trends, and creates charts to show insights.

Objectives
Load and clean COVID-19 data.

Study trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations.

Compare data between countries.
Create charts to visualize trends.

Share findings with code and explanations.

Tools Used

Python 3.13

Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly (optional)

Dataset: owid-covid-data.csv from Our World in Data

How to Run

Install Requirements:

Install Python 3.13.

Install libraries:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly
Download owid-covid-data.csv and place it in the project folder.

Get the Code:

git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-name>



Run the Script:

python project.py

This will show:
Data summaries (cases, deaths, etc.).

Charts: line charts for cases/deaths, bar chart for new cases, and (if plotly is installed) a world map.

Optional:

Use Jupyter Notebook for interactive viewing:

pip install jupyter
jupyter notebook

Insights

Findings:

USA had the most cases due to its large population.

India vaccinated quickly, beating Kenya by mid-2021.

Kenya’s death rate was low, possibly due to reporting differences.

India had a big case spike in 2021 (likely Delta variant).

What I Learned:

Handling missing data was tricky but important.

Charts make trends easier to understand.

Combining code and explanations helps share findings.

I could improve it with more countries or a web app.

Notes

Ensure owid-covid-data.csv is in the project folder.

Skip the map section if plotly isn’t installed.

The script runs without errors in Python 3.13.
